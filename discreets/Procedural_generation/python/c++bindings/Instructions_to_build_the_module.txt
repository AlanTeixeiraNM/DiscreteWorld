This manual explains how to build the Python shared module file necessary for the modules Planets and Draw_Planet to work.

1-First install pybind11 as a regular Python package using pip:
	pip install pybind11

Pybind11 is the library we need to build binding code between C++ and Python. See more on
https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable

2-Get CMake. There are many ways you can install CMake, mine came with a bunch of others binaries (including gcc compilers) from https://winlibs.com/. You can also download it from the official website https://cmake.org/, there you can even get a GUI for CMake projects called cmake-gui.

3-Adjust "Path" on the CMakeLists.txt file in c++bindings folder

4-Create a subfolder called build, go into it, open a command line interface (PowerShell, Bash, etc.) there, execute the following
	cmake -G "Generator option" ../

"Generator option" depends on the build system you use. For example if you want a Python module for a Windows version of Python I recommend using 
the option "Visual Studio 17 2022" (you need VS 2022 installed).
There are other options: "Ninja", "Unix Makefiles", "XCode". See more on https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html

5-Now, still from build folder, on command line interface, execute
	cmake --build . --config Release

If everything went well a shared library file (extension .pyd on Windows and .so on Linux) called something like "Elite_planets" was built in the build folder or inside a Release subfolder in the build folder (you only need this file, everything else generated can be deleted).

6-At last adjust Planets.py and Draw_Planets.py paths according to your case

Now you can visualize simple representations of each planet in the sequence of Elite game. You can adapt all modules and algorithms if you want more elaborate drawings.
